I created a weather application that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather data. The application is constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing a design that is both functional and visually appealing.

Functional Highlights:

Sophisticated Design: The interface features a full-background image and semi-transparent styling elements, offering an engaging user experience.
Responsive Framework: Leveraging Flexbox, the layout adjusts seamlessly across different devices, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.
Live Data Retrieval: Users can input any city to receive up-to-date weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, displayed promptly on the page.
Robust Error Handling: The application is equipped with user feedback mechanisms to handle non-existent location queries effectively.
Styling and Aesthetics: I've selected 'Open Sans' for its clear legibility and applied a monochromatic color palette with transparent features to establish depth in the visual hierarchy.
Interactivity and Functionality:

The dynamic aspects of the application are driven by JavaScript. It manages API interactions, processes user input, and manipulates the DOM to render the weather data accurately.
